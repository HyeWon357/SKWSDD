                <h3>What is Bombardment of Yeonpyeong?</h3>

                <p>
                    The bombardment of Yeonpyeong was an artillery engagement between the North Korean military and
                    South
                    Korean
                    forces stationed on Yeonpyeong Island on November 23 2010.
                    Following a South Korean artillery exercise in waters in the south, North Korean forces fired around
                    170
                    artillery shells and rockets at Yeonpyeong Island, hitting both military and civilian targets.

                <h3> Military responses and After Nov 23 2010 </h3>

                <p>
                    President Lee instructed the South Korean military to strike North Korea's missile base near its
                    coastal
                    artillery positions if there were an indication of further provocation.
                    Lee Hong-gi of the JCS told the media that the attack had been a "premeditated, intentional illegal
                    violation of
                    the U.N. Convention, the Armistice Agreement and the inter-Korean non-aggression accord.
                    It is also an inhumane atrocity, in which [North Korea] indiscriminately fired shells into unarmed
                    civilian
                    residential areas."
                    He said that the military had "strengthened our surveillance and monitoring to keep watch on North
                    Korean
                    military activities through close cooperation with the United States.
                    We are closely cooperating to draw up joint response directions."
                </p>

                <p>
                    On 24 November, the US aircraft carrier USS George Washington departed for joint exercises in the
                    Yellow
                    Sea
                    with the Republic of Korea Navy,
                    in part to deter further North Korean military action but also to "send a message" to China.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On 28 November, South Korean news agency Yonhap News said that North Korea had readied
                    surface-to-surface
                    missiles as the United States and South Korea began military drills.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On 21 December, South Korea carried out another live-fire artillery exercise into the same disputed
                    waters
                    just
                    south of the NLL, despite diplomatic opposition from China and Russia.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One year after the event the South Korean military presence on the island had been substantially
                    increased
                    with
                    the deployment of more K-9 howitzers, K-10 automatic ammunition re-supply vehicles, 130-millimeter,
                    36-round,
                    truck-mounted Kuryong multiple rocket launchers and AH-1S Cobra attack helicopters.
                    On 19 May 2013 the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff announced that "dozens" of Spike NLOS missiles
                    had
                    been
                    deployed on Baengnyeong Island and Yeonpyeong Island.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Their bodies were laid to rest at the Daejeon National Cemetery.

                <h3> Speculation on North Korean motives </h3>

                <p>
                    North Korea's motives for the attack were unclear and were the subject of widespread speculation in
                    the
                    South
                    and elsewhere.
                    Officially, the North Korean Foreign Ministry stated the North Korean bombardment was retaliation
                    due to
                    South
                    Korea's shelling into sea that North Korea claims as its own.
                    But some experts suggested that it was at least partly related to Kim Jong-un's appointment as the
                    designated
                    successor to Kim Jong-Il, which is believed to have caused tensions within the North Korean
                    leadership.
                    Robert Kelly, an assistant professor at Pusan National University in South Korea, says that Seoul's
                    increasing
                    global stature may have provoked Pyongyang. "My primary guess is that this is a response to the
                    recent
                    international prestige taken by South Korea at the G20.
                    The G20 highlighted North Korean backwardness in the same way that it highlighted that South Korea
                    was a
                    partner
                    of this global elite organization, setting international rules and the North Koreans don't like
                    this",
                    he
                    said.
                    It has also been suggested that the attack was linked to the North's need for food aid.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The JoongAng Ilbo newspaper suggested that the attack had been ordered by Kim Jong-Il himself.
                    Kim and his son were reported to have visited the Kaemori artillery base, whence many of the North
                    Korean
                    shells
                    were fired, the day before the attack.
                    The Kims had visited a nearby fish farm on 22 November in the company of various senior military
                    figures.
                    According to a source quoted by the newspaper,
                    "Firing artillery across the Northern Limit Line at sea is difficult without a direct order from
                    Pyongyang’s
                    highest authorities; firing inland would have been impossible without the will of Kim Jong-Il
