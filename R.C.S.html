                <h3> Cause of sinking </h3>

                <p>
                    On 20 May the South Korean-led investigation group released a summary of their report in which they
                    concluded that the sinking of the warship was the result of a North Korean torpedo attack,
                    commenting
                    that
                    "The
                    evidence points overwhelmingly to the conclusion that the torpedo was fired by a North Korean
                    submarine."
                    The
                    inquiry also alleged that a group of small submarines, escorted by a support ship, departed from a
                    North
                    Korean
                    naval base a few days before the sinking. The specific weapon used was alleged to be a North
                    Korean manufactured CHT-02D torpedo, of which substantial parts were recovered.

                    According to the Chosun Ilbo, South Korean investigators told their journalists that they believe
                    that
                    one
                    or
                    two North Korean submarines, a Yono-class submarine and the other a Sang-O-class submarine, departed
                    a
                    naval
                    base at Cape Bipagot accompanied by a support ship on 23 March 2010. One of the subs, according to
                    the
                    report,
                    detoured around to the west side of Baengnyeong Island, arriving on 25 March 2010. There, it waited
                    about 30
                    metres (98 ft) under the ocean's surface in waters 40 to 50 metres (130 to 160 ft) deep for Cheonan
                    to
                    pass
                    by.

                    Investigators believe that the submarine fired the torpedo from about 3 km away. The attack appears
                    to
                    have
                    been
                    timed for a period when tidal forces in the area were slow. The North Korean vessels returned to
                    port on
                    28
                    March 2010. Such detailed information on the North Korean submarine movements, and attack position,
                    was
                    not
                    in the official summary or final report.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The torpedo parts recovered at the site of the explosion by a dredging ship on 15 May which include
                    the
                    5×5
                    bladed contra-rotating propellers, propulsion motor and a steering section, was claimed to match the
                    schematics
                    of the CHT-02D torpedo included in introductory brochures provided to foreign countries by North
                    Korea
                    for
                    export purposes. An incorrect, though similar, torpedo schematic had by mistake been shown at the
                    televised
                    RIG
                    briefing for comparison with the recovered parts.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The correct schematic has never been made public. The markings in Hangul, which reads "1번" (or No. 1
                    in
                    English), found inside the end of the propulsion section, is consistent with the marking of a
                    previously
                    obtained North Korean torpedo, but inconsistent with one found seven years ago, which is marked
                    "4호."
                    Critics have pointed out that '호" is the term used most often in the North, rather than "번." Russian
                    and
                    Chinese torpedoes are marked in their respective languages. The CHT-02D torpedo manufactured by
                    North
                    Korea
                    utilizes acoustic/wake homing and passive acoustic tracking methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Simulations indicated that 250 kg (550 lb) of TNT equivalent explosive at 6 to 9 metres (20 to 30
                    ft)
                    depth,
                    3
                    metres (9.8 ft) to the port of the center line, would result in the damage seen to Cheonan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The full report had not been released to the public at this time, though the South Korean
                    legislature
                    was
                    provided with a five-page synopsis of the report.

                <h3> After March 26. 2010 </h3>

                <P>
                    On 15 April 2010, the stern section of the ship was winched from the seabed by a large floating
                    crane,
                    drained
                    of water and placed on a barge for transportation to the Pyongtaek navy base. On 23 April 2010, the
                    stack
                    was recovered, and on 24 April the bow portion was raised. The salvaged parts were taken to
                    Pyongtaek
                    navy base for an investigation into the cause of the sinking by both South Korean and foreign
                    experts.
                </P>

                <p>
                    The bodies of 40 personnel out of 46 who went down with the ship were recovered. Their bodies were
                    laid
                    to
                    rest at the Daejeon National Cemetery.
                </p>
